# Electrical_Power_Prediction
This is a project for ISS group Saarland University.
This is a ML project for Combined Cycle Power Plant(CCPP). Dataset has been collected over 6 years (2006-2011).Features have hourly average ambient variables Temperature (T),Ambient Pressure (AP),
Relative Humidity (RH) and Exhaust Vacuum (V) to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (PE) of the plant.

Note: As I have worked in google Colab, there are some google colab "file upload" and data read codes. Before using this in personal pc, please remove this codes and change the file locations with respect to your local location.
